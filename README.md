# CV

This is the repository that hosts my CV in `TeX` format.

## Prerequisites

### Local installation

A full `TeX` distribution is required. Various distributions are available for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix).

Here is the procedure for Mac on which `brew` is available:

Install `MacTex`: `$> brew cask install mactex`

This should install everything you need.

Configure your path:

`$> open /Applications/TeX/What\ Is\ Installed.pdf`

In this `pdf` you will find the folder where the binaries are installed. In my case it is `/usr/local/texlive/2017`.

Add the binary directory to your `PATH`: `$> export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-darwin/:$PATH"`

If you encounter the following error, please download the `.otf` and double click on it to install it. Install the FontAwesome font from the `fonts` folder.

### Docker

[`rabbf`](https://hub.docker.com/u/raabf) provides a `docker` [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/raabf/latex-versions/dockerfile) able to compile this repository smoothly. (Note the image is quite big. Might be valueable to shrink it in a CI environment.)

If you want to use this simple solution you need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Then at the root of this repository:

```shell
$> docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` raabf/latex-versions:texlive2018 make cv && open dist/cv.pdf
```

## GitHub Actions

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions/) and leverage open source actions:

- [aws cli](https://github.com/actions/aws/tree/master/cli) from [`actions`](https://github.com/actions), it helps uploading the artifact on S3
- [upload-to-release](https://github.com/JasonEtco/upload-to-release) from [JasonEtco](https://github.com/JasonEtco) which enables storing the CV in the release
